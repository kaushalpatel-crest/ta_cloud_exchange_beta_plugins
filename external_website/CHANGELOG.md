# 1.2.0-beta
## Fixed
- The pull functionality now includes an option to choose whether to extract only the domain name or use the full URL. For example, if the URL is google.com/abc/xyz, selecting Yes will extract only the domain google.com, while selecting No will retain the full URL google.com/abc/xyz. This setting is applicable only when the indicator type 'URL' is selected in the 'Type of Threat Data to Pull' configuration parameter.
